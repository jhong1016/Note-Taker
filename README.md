### Issues Encountered

Files from "Developed" folder were deleted and new files were created in the main directory, which has accidentally deleted ALL commitments :( . 

However, past history of commitments can be accessed by clicking on 'server.js' file, then clicking on 'History' at the top right corner, and then clicking on "screenshot added to assets folder and files copy/pasted from develop..." commitment link. This will lead marker to all previous commits' history.
